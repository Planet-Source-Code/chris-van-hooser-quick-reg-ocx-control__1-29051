## Quick Reg OCX control


</div>

### Description

Have you ever wanted to have your project set up to have people have to register with you to unlock certain parts of the project. Well, i have made a simple to use control just for this purpose. Just slap this control onto a form, set a few values, and you will be able to generate custom keys depending on the name of the users computer, or a serial number. You can also use a combonation of these to make a harder to crack key. What the code does is, if the setting is set to ComputerName, it finds out the name of the computer, goes through my alogorithim, and makes a key for that name. When the use puts that key into a text box or something, you can call my control to see if that key is correct. The control will respond with a boolean value, if the key is correct, it will be true, but if the control determines the key to not be right, it will reject the key with a false value. This code is heavily commented (prolly more comments then code), but the code is effectivly explained (well in my eyes it is), and will show you how to set this up. Also included in this visual basic group, is a sampel program giving the basics on how to use the control. This is only version 1.0, i plan on updateing it with more features in the future, maybe something along the lines of add a demo-time limit function to it, where it will only allow the user to use a program for a specified amount of time. Feel free to use this code in your own programs, but if you just copy/paste it from here, i would apprieciate some credit. :D. If you have any questions/comments/or anything else, post here, or email me at theendorbunker@home.com. Last, if you use this, and if you want, place a vote on this project.

Thanks for reading, and i hope you enjoy this program.
